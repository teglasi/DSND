## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

The Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2018 data set is available at https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I conducted a research about professional software developers, who have moved into the field in the past five years. I wanted to know which positions they target, how they feel about their career and what they plan for the future.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@istvan.teglas/career-change-into-software-development-42a7723cc7e).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
